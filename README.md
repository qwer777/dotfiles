# dotfiles
Common dotfiles that I use.
To easily install and setup this repo, run the following line:
```
wget git.io/mydotfiles && chmod u+x mydotfiles && ./mydotfiles
```
Or, if you want to review the code before running it:
```
wget git.io/mydotfiles && chmod u+x mydotfiles && less mydotfiles
```
will get it readfy to be ran, and then show you the code. If it's acceptable and you want to go ahead with the install, just run: 
```
./mydotfiles
```
